# JS-airborne-transmission
The airborne transmission model -- coded in Javascript


index.html -- is a very bare skeleton of elements that we'll require on the website. The model is called using the script/main.js.

script/main.js -- has a list of parameters that are the inputs to the model. These need to be converted to be pulled from the user-input form. Then the script calls the functions of the model with those inputs.

script/functions.js -- contains all the definitions of functions that run the model.
