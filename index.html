<h1> COVID-19 Airborne Transmission Risk Calculator </h1>
Needed: a simple explanation of how this model works. Probably needs a picture or two. <br>
Then insert link to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12267.pdf">paper</a>.

<h2>Needed: A form for the user to enter the inputs of the algorithm. </h2>
Inputs required are floats. Also requires form to check that the inputs are positive numbers. <br>
Inputs are blank unless specified otherwise. 

<h3>Category 1: Room Properties</h3> 
Room length  (m), l <br>
Room width (m), w <br>
Room height (m), h <br>
Ventilation: Air Changes per Hour (h^{-1}), Q -- requires dropdown list with common options, and option for user to input their own value<br>
Airflow velocity (m), (v_x,v_y) -- might change this input to make it more user friendly: to only choose a direction of the airflow loop<br>

<h3>Category 2: Event Properties</h3>
Time (h), time <br>
Coordinates of infectious person (m), (x_o,y_o) <br>
Fraction of time the infectious person spends talking, frac_speak <br>
Coordinates of susceptible person (m), (x,y) -- want interactive form to allow user to input the number of susceptible persons and the coordinates of each <br>

<h3>Submit buttons</h3>

<h3>Advanced options</h3>
This part of the form to be shown only if user clicks on the link. Values to this part of the form should be prefilled with recommended values.
<h4> Accuracy</h4>
With warning: that smaller figures lead to more accurate results, but longer run times. <br>
Time step (s) <br>
delta_x (m) <br>
delta_y (m) <br>
<h4>Virus Parameters </h4>
Particle settling rate, s (s^{-1}) <br>
Virus deactivation rate, d (s^{-1}) <br>
Conversion rate from infectious particles to infectious quantum, k -- requires link to explanation and rational for value <br>
<h4> Behaviourial Parameters </h4>
With warning: change with caution <br>
Passive infectious particle emission rate (particles/s), R <br>
Type of mask worn by infectious person -- a dropdown list, mask_ex <br>
Average breathing rate of susceptible person, p -- a dropdown list <br>
Type of mask worn by susceptible persons -- a dropdown list, mask_in <br>
